# A Day without Gadgets

    Art of Doing Nothing for a Day

## Introduction
**My** sleeping pattern is generally from 3 AM to 11 AM. So, after waking up I pass time with family and have breakfast (ok ok lunch). Later on, I start working on my laptop and this goes till 3 AM.

**Once** I tried to stay free for the whole day without using a laptop or phone (Laptop is my soulmate). 
>Mom was like - Beta tumse na ho payega.

Oh gosh, this was a very hard decision to stay away from gadgets for a day. From here I learned **the art of doing nothing.**

So on that day, what I did was, read the newspaper for an hour, had my breakfast (I'm not gonna call it lunch), took a 2 hours long power nap :). After that read a book for 2 hours and played cricket with my elder brother.
Now, it was dinner time, so I was thinking about what to do for the next 6 hours. We've android TV at home with access to all premium streaming platforms but we don't know what to watch there (Don't know how people keep on saying - watch Netflix).


> PS : I keep on asking people - Bhai koi movie batade.

So, I tried a new thing to call people who were close to me during college but we've not talked for the past 6 - 7 months (nahi nahi ladayi nahi huyi thi hamari). This was the best thing I thought of doing to keep the closer ones close. The call could be from 30 seconds to 60 minutes. but to me my surprise I called 5 people and the average time was 40 minutes (haan baba I used phone but not to use social media) and after that had some talk with my brother. It felt great to do so.

>Okay he added few lines to my blog - I love my bade bhaiya, he is the bessssteeessttt bhaiya. thanks for adopting me. love youuuuuuuuuuu.

 So, yeah staying free is also an art especially for our generation. Do give it a try, you surely gonna love it.
